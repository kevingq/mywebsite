      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
          Shown below is a visualization of how a neural network might be used to predict the positions of the bursts of light. 
          We pass the times of the collisions as inputs to the network, each wall mapped to its own input node. 
          Then the network propogates the data through the layers, until the final layer. Imagine perhaps each node in 
          the output layer represents a quadrant of the detector (top right, top left, bottom left, bottom right) and the 
          node that activates the most is the network's prediction as to which quadrant of the detector the burst happened in.
      </p>
      <div style="width: 100%;text-align: center;">
        <img src="src/network/full_network.gif" width="500px" style="border: solid;">
      </div>
      <p>
        So, in the animation the output node "22" activated the most (the cyan node), so that would mean the network predicted 
        the burst occured in the bottom left quadrant of the detector. Designing a network that's efficient and accurate at
        producing this behaviour is a whole problem in itself itself, and that's where the "learning" part of "machine learning"
        comes into this. Using training and testing data sets, the network can "learn" how to accurately predict in which quadrant 
        the burst happened, based only on the timing info fed to it by the detector.
      </p>
      <h1>Fitting a line to data</h1>
      <p>
        Thinking from the ground up, the system described in the previous section is kind of a far-off dream. In order to do this in
        a way that feels intuitive (at least to me), we're going to have to scale back the complexity of the problem to a much, <i>much</i>
        simpler one and build from there. We're going to start by using one of the simplest data models possible: the line. It only has two
        parameters: a slope and a y intercept (we'll refer to them as m and b, respectively).
      </p>
      <div style="width: 100%;text-align: center;">
        <img src="src/network/Fit_line.gif" width="300px">
      </div>
      <p>
        Fitting a line to two data points is a relatively simple problem because there is definitely a "perfect" answer.
        It'll always be possible to find a combination of a slope and a y intercept such that the line travels through both points.
        The problem kind of spirals in difficulty when you increase the data set to three or more points though, assuming the points
        are such that one line <i>cannot</i> go through all the points, such as in the example shown below. It's possible to select
        a slope and y intercept so that a line goes perfectly through the first two data points, or through the last two data points,
        but <i>not</i> all three. So how do we find a slope and y intercept that <i>best</i> represents the data set with the knowledge
        that it can't be <i>perfect</i>?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, perhaps a question that's more important to answer first is <i>why</i> we want to find the slope and y intercept that best
        fits the data. It would be very understandable for the connection to appear quite tenuous. I think the connection to neural networks
        will make more sense if we delve a bit into how we create a line, specifically using the framework of an input-output machine.
        When applied to algebra, this is called a <i>function</i>. 
      </p>
      <div style="width: 100%;text-align: center;">
        <img src="src/network/BlackBox.gif" width="400px">
      </div>

      <p>
        We now have a framework that we can use to visualize the problem a little more clearly. We can pick a certain slope and y
        intercept and let our machine make a line for us that has those parameters. We can calculate the error associated with
        that combination of parameters. If we recalculate that error for a slope that's slightly increased and the error goes down,
        then the <i>rate of change</i> of the error with respect to <i>the slope</i> is negative. If the error goes up, the rate of
        change is positive. Either way, if we <i>subtract</i> the rate of change of the error with respect to a parameter <i>from</i>
        that parameter, we'll always get a model that has a lower error than the one before it. This is the method of <i>gradient
        descent</i>. I've animated a step by step walkthrough of how this algorithm works using three separate plots that update in
        parallel.
      </p>
      <div style="width: 100%;text-align: center;">
        <img src="src/network/grad_descent_walkthrough.gif" width="800px">
      </div>
      <p>
        You may notice that in that walkthrough, only the slope is being adjusted. The power of the gradient descent algorithm lies 
        in treating the parameters of the model as a <i>vector</i>, and updating the parameters in parallel using a <i>vector</i>.
        You can see the vectorized algorithm applied to a different data set in the animation shown below. You can see that both
        the y-intercept and the slope are being updated in parallel, resulting in the model approaching its minimum error of 0.05.
      </p>
      <div style="width: 100%;text-align: center;">
        <img src="src/network/Grad_descent.gif" width="300px">
      </div>
      <p>
        There is still a large obstacle we need to overcome before we can build and train the network we saw in the first animation. 
        The stepping stone is designing a network with multiple weights. It's a significant step because the implementation of a 
        network with multiple weights will allow us to utilize a structure that we can scale up to a single network that can process 
        4 independent inputs. We'll scale up the problem by adding an extra dimension to our parameter space. In this next problem, 
        we're adjusting the parameters of a <i>plane</i> instead of a line. The fit model is analogous to a neural network with a 
        single node that has <i>two</i> weights and a bias. The animation below shows how changing the plane's parameters affect the 
        model's goodness of fit.
