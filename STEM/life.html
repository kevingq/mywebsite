    <h2>The Game of Life</h2>


    <h1>Theory</h1>
    <p>
      The Game of Life is an idea that was proposed by Joseph Conway in 1970. The idea is to apply a set
      of rules to a grid of cells, where the parameters of the grid determine its subsequent state.
      The set of rules are as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style="float:none">A living cell with less than two living neighbours will die.</li>
      <li style="float:none">A living cell with two or three living neighbours will live.</li>
      <li style="float:none">A living cell with more than three living neighbours will die.</li>
      <li style="float:none">A dead cell with exactly three living neighbours will revive.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For example, let's take a look at the scenario shown in the plot below. We have two three by three
      grids of cells, each cell with an assigned letter. The grid on the left represents
      the initial state of the simulation, and the grid on the right represents the next state. In the
      initial state, cells a, b, c, d, f, g, h, and i are all dead. The only way for any of their states to change is
      for them to have three living neighbours, but each one of these cells has exactly one living 
      neighbour (cell e). Thus, they all will stay dead. Cell e has zero living neighbours, so it
      encounters rule 1 and will die.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;padding-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;">
      <img src="src/the game of life/scenario0.png" width="500px">
    </div>
    <p>
      Let's practice a little more. The situation below shows an application of rules 1, 2 and 4. Cells b and h have only 1 living 
      neighbour (cell e), so they will both die. Cell e has two living neighbours (cells b and h), so it will live. Lastly,
      cells d and f both have exactly three living neighbours, so they will both revive. Cells a, c, g, and i are dead and
      all have exactly 2 living neighbours, but they require exactly three in order to qualify for rule 4, so they will stay dead.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;padding-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;">
      <img src="src/the game of life/scenario1.png" width="500px">
    </div>
    <p>
      Okay just one more, and then we'll have seen all of the rules in action at least once. Cells a, c, g, and i are alive but all
      have only one living neighbour (cell e), so they will encounter rule 1 and die. Cell e has 4 living neighbours (a, c, g, and i), 
      so it will encounter rule 3 and will also die. Cells b, d, f, and h are dead and have exactly three living neighbours, so they
      will all revive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's where we can start to get creative. Let's set up our simulation to use a 50x50 grid, then we'll put a
      a tiny blob in each of the four corners. We let the rules of the game take over and watch the simulation unfold.
      Interestingly, the blobs move in ways that are all completely unique to each other, despite my initial instincts telling 
      me their behaviours should all be identical. Eventually, the blobs spread out and collide with each other, eventually 
      conglomerating into a single homogenous swarm.

      I also had a lot of fun building a house and having a spaceship in the sky destroy it before disappearing through a portal.

    </div>
    <p>
      Being creative is great, but I'm also interested in studying this game from a more analytical perspective. I'm wondering
      how far I can get in understanding how this strange world of pixelated blobs works. The first thing I want to investigate
      is how the density of the simulation affects how long the simulation will survive for. This begs the non-trivial question of 
      what survival refers to here. I haven't worked out the details yet, but my idea is to assign a given simulation run with a metric
      I'll call its 'life index'. The closer the index is to 1, the more 'alive' the cells are in the simulation run, and the closer it
      is to 0, the more dead they are. The life index should be inversely correlated it to the run's repetitiveness. For example, if 
      the cells in a run show no change at all across a given range of simulation steps, this simulation is displaying high repetitiveness,
      and thus should be assigned a low life index. If however, a sample of simulation steps shows absolutely no repetition (the simulation 
      does not return even once to a state it was in previously during the range being studied), the simulation should be assigned with 
      very high life index.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see this idea applied the figure shown below. Each plot shows a different simulation run, where each starts out with a
      randomly generated state using the procedure of assigning each cell with a 50% chance of being alive or dead. The rows are grouped
      by simulation density, where each row is more dense than the one above it because it has more cells packed into the same space.
      You can see that the rightmost runs in the 3rd and 4th rows down display oscillatory behaviour, where they're just cycling back
      forth. The life index for these runs will never reach zero, but also will never change from their value which should be very close to zero.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;padding-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;">
      <img src="src/the game of life/density_analysis.gif" width="400px">
    </div>
    <p>
      If we establish a threshold for the life index, below which the simulation is considered dead, this allows us to measure the lifetime
      of the simulation. We're now set up enough for me to be able to state my hypothesis, which is that the average lifetime of the simulation
      is directly proportional to its density.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next step in this project is going to be designing an algorithm that takes in a range of consecutive steps of a certain run and 
      accurately assigns to it its life index. I have a few ideas for how I might go about designing this algorithm, but the only one that immediately
      jumps out at me is a neural network. The problem is that it's not really a feasible solution at the current state of my skill
      in designing neural networks. Another less robust algorithm would be to create a copy of the grid, where each cell in this new grid will be assigned
      the average state of its corresponding cell across the simulation run. Intuitively I would think more repetitive runs will tend to 
      have highly concentrated pockets of cells, whereas less repetitive runs will have average states that are more evenly distributed across the grid.

    <h1>Can we make an actual game out of this?</h1>
    <p>
      You may read have read through this article up until now with a burning question: "Okay, but where's the <i>game</i>??". That's a fair question,
      one that I find myself asking as well. "The Game of Life", referring to the idea developed by Joseph Conway is really more of a recipe for a physics
      engine than a game itself. To make it into a game, at least in the way we tend to use the term today, we're going to have to add some features.
      I tried to make it feel more like a game by adding these features:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style="float:none">Adding a controllable player</li>
      <li style="float:none">A mechanic that procedurally generates enemies</li>
      <li style="float:none">Restrictions on player movement (can not exit bounds of the world)</li>
      <li style="float:none">A way to lose the game</li>
      <li style="float:none">A way to win the game (beat your high score)</li>
    </ol>
