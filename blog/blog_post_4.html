    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Fievel's adventure story</h3>
    <p>
      I heard the Rumbling and immediately dropped my task of trying to chew my way through a 
      plastic wrapper. Luckily I’d found it right next to the entrance of our home: a box we’d 
      stuck into the corner of our world. I scurried inside, relieved to see most of my family 
      already there. They all looked groggy, presumably all having just been woken up from their 
      group nap by the terrible noise crashing around us.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mom and Dad aren't back yet.” I stated nervously to Quagmire, who had come up beside me rubbing his 
      eyes sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Probably just around the corner” He responded. “They said they weren’t going far today.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yeah I hope you’re right.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten tense seconds passed. The Rumbling just kept getting louder and louder. Just then, 
      careening around the corner of an old rusty structure came Mom and Dad, neck in neck as 
      they sprinted for our home. Their whiskers brushed together as they leapt in synchronicity 
      through a tissue box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was the Silence: the moment of pause before the Tremors. I could all of a 
      sudden feel my heartbeat, pounding quick and heavy. Mom kept her pace without wavering, but 
      Dad stopped for a moment, startled by the sudden change. Silence gave way to the Tremors, 
      shaking the world with terrible power. I watched in helpless horror as a giant metal box 
      tipped over and crashed into the space between Mom and Dad. She had stopped when she noticed 
      he was no longer beside her, and looked back to see the look of paralyzed fear on his face 
      as the metal box closed them off from each other. She turned back to us for a moment. She 
      looked right at me. I wanted to yell but the words were caught in my throat. She had a grim 
      look on her face as she turned back. The last I saw of her was her deftly leaping onto a 
      candle and launching herself on top of the fallen metal box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lifting began and I felt tears well up in my eyes. I fell back into the padding of our 
      home, letting go as the world turned to chaos. I saw brief flashes of light amidst the chaos 
      as I tumbled around with my family members. Eventually, there was only quiet again, and the 
      Upheaval was over. One by one we clambered out of our home, dazed and confused, bleary eyed 
      in the harsh sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen up guys." Said Quagmire to the family of 22 mice. "We need to get organized for a bit." 
    </p>
      "Shouldn't we wait for Mom and Dad?" Interrupted a mouse named Othello. "They're still in the House."
    <p>
      Quagmire was quiet. I decided to speak up to fill the silence. "They..." I realized I didn't know how to 
      finish my sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They didn't make it." Finished Quagmire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But-but that doesn't make sense. What are you talking about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It means they're gone, Othello. They were taken by the Heaver." Quagmire's voice was gentle,
      but there was a tremble in it that he was trying hard to hide. I could tell he was struggling to keep it
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's right." I spoke up. "I saw it happen. Mom was close, but she turned back because Dad got 
      stuck by the Tremors. Then the Lifting started. That's the last I saw of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So what are we going to do?!" Panic rose in Othello's voice and it reverberated through 
      the crowd of 22 other mice. A frantic whisper spread through the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're going to keep doing what we were doing before the Upheaval." Quagmire shouted to the whole,
      silencing the whispers. "Stash the food storage back up with what fell out. Keep looking for Stickies.
      That's what Mom said to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We haven't found any Stickies in <i>days!</i> Quagmire." 
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well what's your big idea Othello?" Shot back Quagmire. He was getting angry, and I was getting worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we should stop acting like everything is okay. Mom and Dad are <i>gone</i>. And you just want us
      to continue on like nothing happened? You're absolutely delusional if you think I'm going to listen to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know what Othello, go chew a rock."
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole crowd erupted into shouting. A mouse named Sycamore grabbed Othello's attention and looked to be
      trying to defend Quagmire. I tugged on Quagmire's ear and we stepped away. "Maybe Othello's onto something."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quagmire rolled his eyes. "You've gotta be kidding me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm serious Quagmire. Maybe we should take this as an opportunity to change how we think about things a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is exactly the time when it's most important to stick to the plan. It's the best chance we have to keep
      us all alive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, because that's what Mom said? She didn't know everything you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut up Fievel." Quagmire said quietly. His words stung, and I realized I'd hit a big nerve for him to lash out
      like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look-I'm sorry. That was insensitive. I'm just... I'm trying to figure out if the best course of action
      changes if we zoom out a big on the bigger picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quagmire's anger seemed to cool a little. "Fine. Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we should consider the possibility that finding the giant roll of Sticky all that time ago was an
      anomaly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We found that jar the other day, with a bit of Sticky at the bottom!" Argued Quagmire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was the first one we've found in <i>days</i>. And we can't stop the Littles from picking away at it.
      Most of it is already gone. Maybe our survival this far using Stickies that get dropped in here has been
      strokes of luck that won't hold up forever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well what do you propose instead Sister?" He asked. 
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well... I could go look for some." Quagmire stared at me blankly so I continued. "Like... Outside the World."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh not this again! We've talked about this Fievel."
    </p>
    <p>
      I shift back and forth on my feet in frustratedly. "It's the best idea we have besides waiting and praying, Brother. And
      you all can keep doing that, but I've been <i>losing</i> my <i>mind</i> here. I need to go do something else. To go
      <i>try</i> something else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry Fievel but I just can't think about this right now." Quagmire's tone softened as he continued and he
      grimaced, the pain clearly displayed on his face. "It's too upsetting to talk about any more. We just lost Mom and Dad. I... 
      I don't want to lose you too."
    </p>
    <p>
      My frustration receded with his display of vulnerability, replaced by panic as he turned to return his attention to the 
      crowd of arguing mice. The group had thinned considerably, some mice going back into the home, some had gone off to 
      hunt for scraps remaining after the Upheaval, but the vast majority were still standing around shouting at each other.
      Before I could think better of it, I blurted "I could find Mom and Dad."
    </p>  
    <p>
      He stopped, turning slowly back towards me. He said nothing, just looked at me. He looked frustrated, with a hint of fear.
      Fear of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      My words came rushing out now, my tail flicking around nervously. "Maybe they didn't get swept up 
      by the Heaver. Maybe they landed in the Outside, running around trying to make it in that new World. Maybe- maybe if I got 
      out too then I could find them, and together we could find some way to  get back in here." My words successfully ignited 
      the hope in him, now burning bright in his eyes. I felt a pang of guilt for having manipulated him a little bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you so desperate to get me on board with this Fievel?"
    </p>

    <p>
      ...
    </p>
    <p>
      I wandered idly along the barren floor of our World. Already a giant metal box had been dropped in. I recognized 
      this type, it had a button that if you pushed with enough force would pop open the front of it. The interior 
      sometimes held little crumbs and sugary residue, a tasty afternoon snack for a hungry mouse such as myself. 
    </p>
    <p>  
      I thought about Quagmire confessing his fear about losing me. He very seldom talks about his feelings like that, a habit 
      that I think he got that way from watching Mom. He saw her as having this drive to hide her vulnerability. I guess in 
      his mind she wanted to shield us from uncertainty.
